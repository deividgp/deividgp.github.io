  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    I am a software developer with two higher vocational trainings: web apps development and cross-platform apps development.
    The knowledge I am acquiring through professional experience and selflearning makes me an excellent candidate for medium level jobs since I can develop in many frameworks and runtimes with ease.
    <br><br>
    I started programming in 2016 when I initiated the web apps development studies. 
    I have mainly been a backend developer using technologies such as Spring and Laravel/Symfony all this time up until 2022 when I started my current job as a .NET Core developer using C# along with Blazor.
    In the summer of the same year my frontend knowledge strengthened because I made my bachelor's thesis which consisted of developing a group chat app similar to Discord using React.
    <br><br>
    As I previously said I have always been drawn by backend the most but when I really got fascinated by it was in the Distributed Systems subject, where I learned about technologies such as Redis, RabbitMQ, Go...
    Haven't had many opportunities to put this knowledge into practice yet apart from the assignments from few months ago you can find on my GitHub.
    <br><br>
    As a software developer, I am always motivated to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in the field. 
    I believe that the ability to constantly learn and adapt is essential for success in this rapidly evolving industry.
    <br><br>
    I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow my skillset, whether it be through online courses, watching videos / streamings, or simply staying current with industry news and trends. 
    I am always on the lookout for new technologies and approaches that have the potential to improve my work and make me a more valuable asset to my team. Whether it's learning a new programming language, exploring a new framework or library, or learning more about software architecture in order to become a proficient architect someday, I am always eager to dive in and learn as much as I can.
    <br><br>
    I believe that this drive to constantly learn and improve is what sets successful programmers apart, and I am committed to continuously learning and adapting in order to stay at the forefront of the industry.
